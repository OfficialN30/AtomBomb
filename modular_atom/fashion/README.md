# Fashion Fallout Edition

## What is this module?
All FO servers use the same old ancient set of hairs, going back 11 years and without any real direction. This module curates the content, adds some new hairstyles, removes some old ones, and redoes the majority of the existing ones to improve their quality.

Core principles:
- Hair sorted like facial hair always has been, in categories. Makes it easier to find suitable hair for your character than looking through a long alphabetical list of arbitrarily named hairs.
- Entire lineup redone, old stuff kept when decent, redone if not, tons of edits, new stuff added. Hairs as well as facial hairs.
- Order, same in icon files as in .dms, no duplicates, no unused stuff.
- Collects cosmetics items
- Adds combs/brushes (mood boost, more for longer hairs)
- Adds handheld mirrors (applies makeup, small mood boost)

## Is it complete?
Yes.

- New hair added will only keep the quality the maintainer sets as a bar. 
Implementing the module might affect saved character profiles, it will certainly mess up any saved hairs and facial hairstyles 100%.

## Who dunnit
Some are my own concepts, others edited from minor to total reworks of legacy or other hairstyles from bay and elsewhere, names have been changed when needed to fit the system.
